First things:

1. We always create a new branch
    - e.g. git checkout -b 'lars'
2. We only work in this branch, NEVER main.

Event 1 - when someone else has a branch, and pushed whilst you were working on main.
While working on my branch, the main changed
3.1: Store all files on your branch. (ctrl + s)
3.2: Add changes to your branch: git add my_file1 my_file2
3.3: Check status of git: git status
3.4: Commit the changes to your branch: git commit -m 'A meaningful commit message'
3.5: Push the changes to your branch: git push origin lars
3.6: Go back to main: git checkout main
3.7: Pull the NEW main: git pull origin main
3.8: Go back to your working branch: git checkout lars
3.9: Pull the NEW main into your branch: git merge main  (verify first that you are in your branch)
3.10: If merging conflict come up: Control conflicts and discuss with team (if nessary)
3.11: Keep working on your branch



Event 2 - Added a file, then pushed to main.
You have completed your changes and want to push them to main
4.1: Store all your files on my branch. (ctrl + s)
4.2: Add changes to your branch: git add my_file1 my_file2
4.3: Commit the changes to your branch: git commit -m 'A meaningful commit message'
4.4: Push the changes to my branch: git push origin lars
4.5: Go to github and open pull request.
4.6: Inform everybody and discuss your changes and whether to keep them.
4.7: Merge your version into main (on github).
4.8: Delete your branch on github.
4.9: Pull origin main to your local machine in terminal: git pull origin master (make sure your are in main not in your branch)
4.10: Delete your branch in terminal: git sweep
4.11: Create a new branch and start working on next task.
